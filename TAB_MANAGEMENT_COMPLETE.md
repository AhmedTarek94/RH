# Tab Management System - Completed

## âœ… Task 2: Enhanced Tab Management System

### Completed Subtasks:
- [x] Add task/index page detection and redirection logic
- [x] Update background.js to handle task/index pages in tab scanning
- [x] Update background.js to handle task/index pages in tab activation  
- [x] Update background.js to handle task/index pages in tab updates
- [x] Test the complete tab management system

## Implementation Details

### Functions Added/Updated in background.js:
1. **isTaskIndexTab(url)** - Detects task/index pages
2. **scanAllTabsForMainPage()** - Now handles task/index page redirection
3. **chrome.tabs.onActivated** - Added task/index page handling
4. **chrome.tabs.onUpdated** - Added task/index page handling

### Key Features:
- Automatic detection of task/index pages (https://www.raterhub.com/evaluation/rater/task/index)
- Immediate redirection to main page when task/index page is detected
- Works across all tab events: loading, activation, and periodic scanning
- Only active when extension monitoring is enabled

### Testing:
The system has been tested to ensure:
- Task/index pages are properly detected
- Redirection to main page works correctly
- No interference with other page types (main page, task/show pages)
- Integration with existing monitoring system

## Next Steps
The tab management system is now complete and ready for production use. The extension will automatically redirect users from task/index pages back to the main monitoring page, ensuring optimal monitoring efficiency.
