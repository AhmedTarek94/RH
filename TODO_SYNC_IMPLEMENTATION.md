  - [x] `refreshInterval` - Refresh timing
  - [x] `alertSoundType` - Sound source type
  - [x] `alertSoundData` - Sound file/URL data
  - [x] `darkThemeEnabled` - Theme preference
  - [x] `showTestButton` - Test button visibility
  - [x] `enableDesktopNotifications` - Desktop notifications
  - [x] `enableMouseMovementDetection` - Mouse movement detection
  - [x] `enableIncompleteTasksHandling` - Incomplete tasks handling
  - [x] `enableErrorDetection` - Error detection

### [x] Options Page Enhancements

- [x] `settingsUpdated` - Legacy bulk update messages (maintained)
- [x] `settingChanged` - New individual setting messages

### [x] Error Handling
- [x] Graceful degradation for unavailable components
- [x] Proper error logging and reporting
- [x] Retry mechanisms for failed deliveries

## âœ… COMPLETED - Testing Infrastructure

### [x] Test Files Created

- [x] Success criteria and validation methods

## âœ… COMPLETED - Performance Optimization

### [x] Reduced Page Reloads
- [x] Eliminated unnecessary full page reloads
- [x] Targeted UI updates for changed settings only
- [x] Improved user experience with instant feedback

### [x] Efficient Message Handling
- [x] Minimal payload for individual setting changes
- [x] Optimized broadcast mechanisms
- [x] Reduced CPU and memory usage

## âœ… COMPLETED - Backward Compatibility

### [x] Legacy Support Maintained
- [x] Existing `settingsUpdated` messages still work
- [x] All previous functionality preserved
- [x] No breaking changes to storage structure

### [x] Progressive Enhancement
- [x] New features don't interfere with old functionality
- [x] Graceful fallback for older components
- [x] Seamless upgrade experience

## ðŸŽ¯ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: COMPLETE

All planned real-time synchronization features have been successfully implemented and tested. The RHAT extension now provides instant updates across all components without requiring page reloads.

### Key Achievements:
1. **Real-time Theme Sync** - Instant theme changes across options and popup
2. **Individual Setting Updates** - Targeted UI updates without full reloads  
3. **Cross-component Communication** - Robust message passing between all parts
4. **Performance Optimization** - Reduced CPU usage and better UX
5. **Backward Compatibility** - All existing features preserved
6. **Comprehensive Testing** - Full test coverage and documentation

### Files Modified:
- `background.js` - Enhanced message handling and broadcasting
- `options.js` - Individual setting update handlers
- `popup.js` - Real-time UI synchronization

### Files Created:
- `test_sync_complete.html` - Comprehensive test page
- `SYNC_TEST_PLAN.md` - Test procedures and validation
- `SYNC_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation documentation

The implementation successfully delivers on all requirements for real-time synchronization across the RHAT extension components.
