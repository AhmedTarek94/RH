# TODO: Fix Gmail Authentication Clearing Issue

## Issue Description

When clearing Gmail authentication, the AuthStatusCache was not being invalidated, causing stale authentication status to persist even after clearing.

## Solution Implemented

- Added `AuthStatusCache.invalidateCache();` call in the `handleClearGmailAuth` function in background.js
- This ensures that when authentication is cleared, the cache is properly invalidated
- Next authentication status check will fetch fresh data from storage

## Files Modified

- [x] background.js - Added cache invalidation in handleClearGmailAuth function

## Testing

- [ ] Test clearing Gmail authentication and verify status updates correctly
- [ ] Verify that subsequent authentication status checks return fresh data
- [ ] Confirm that all extension components receive updated authentication status

## Status

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Cache invalidation added to authentication clearing flow
