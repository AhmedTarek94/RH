# Advanced Filtering Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for implementing advanced filtering options for RHAT v1.8.0, allowing users to filter tasks based on specific criteria.

## Features to Implement

### 1. Task Type Filtering
- **Task Category Filter**: Filter by task categories (e.g., Search, Side-by-Side, etc.)
- **Task Complexity Filter**: Filter by task difficulty or estimated time
- **Task Language Filter**: Filter by language requirements

### 2. Time-based Filtering
- **Task Duration Filter**: Filter tasks by estimated completion time
- **Time of Day Filter**: Only monitor during specific hours
- **Day of Week Filter**: Only monitor on specific days

### 3. Priority-based Filtering
- **Task Priority Filter**: Filter by task priority levels
- **Reward-based Filter**: Filter by task reward amounts
- **Urgency Filter**: Filter by task urgency indicators

### 4. Custom Filter Rules
- **Custom Criteria**: User-defined filtering rules
- **Multiple Conditions**: AND/OR logic for combining filters
- **Filter Presets**: Save and load filter configurations

## Implementation Approach

### UI Components
- **Filter Panel**: Expandable section in options page
- **Filter Controls**: Checkboxes, dropdowns, and input fields
- **Filter Status**: Visual indicators of active filters
- **Preset Management**: Save/load/delete filter presets

### Storage Structure
```javascript
{
  "filters": {
    "taskTypes": ["search", "comparison"],
    "minDuration": 5,
    "maxDuration": 30,
    "timeRange": {
      "enabled": false,
      "start": "09:00",
      "end": "17:00"
    },
    "daysOfWeek": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], // Monday-Friday
    "minReward": 0.5,
    "customRules": []
  },
  "filterPresets": {
    "workHours": { ... },
    "highReward": { ... }
  }
}
```

### Integration Points
- **Background Script**: Apply filters during task detection
- **Content Script**: Enhanced task analysis for filtering
- **Options Page**: Filter configuration interface
- **Popup**: Quick filter status and toggle

## Files to Modify

### New Files
- `filters.js` - Filter management and application logic
- `filter-presets.js` - Preset management system

### Modified Files
- `options.html` - Add filter configuration UI
- `options.js` - Integrate filter controls
- `popup.html` - Add filter status indicator
- `popup.js` - Add filter toggle functionality
- `background.js` - Integrate filtering into monitoring
- `content.js` - Enhanced task analysis for filtering
- `styles.css` - Filter UI styling

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Filter System (Week 1)
- [ ] Create filter management system
- [ ] Implement basic filter types (task type, duration)
- [ ] Add filter storage and persistence
- [ ] Integrate with background monitoring

### Phase 2: Advanced Filters (Week 2)
- [ ] Implement time-based filtering
- [ ] Add priority and reward filtering
- [ ] Create custom rule system
- [ ] Add filter validation

### Phase 3: UI Integration (Week 3)
- [ ] Design and implement filter UI in options
- [ ] Add filter status indicators in popup
- [ ] Implement preset management
- [ ] Add filter testing interface

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (Week 4)
- [ ] Comprehensive filter testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] User documentation

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Efficient filter evaluation to minimize monitoring impact
- Caching of filter results
- Optimized DOM queries for task analysis

### User Experience
- Intuitive filter interface
- Clear visual feedback
- Easy preset management
- Responsive design

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when filters fail
- Validation of filter criteria
- Fallback to default behavior

## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests
- Filter application logic
- Preset management
- Validation rules

### Integration Tests
- Filter integration with monitoring
- Cross-component communication
- Storage operations

### User Acceptance Testing
- Filter usability
- Performance impact
- Error scenarios

## Dependencies
- Enhanced task analysis in content script
- Real-time filter updates
- Preset storage and management

## Success Metrics
- Filter application time < 50ms
- No noticeable impact on monitoring performance
- Intuitive user interface
- Comprehensive filter coverage

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing advanced filtering while maintaining the extension's performance and usability.
