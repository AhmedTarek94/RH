# Filter Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Filter UI Design & Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Design filter UI structure in options.html
- [x] Create comprehensive filter settings structure
- [x] Implement filter UI controls:
  - [x] Task type checkboxes (search, evaluation, comparison)
  - [x] Duration range inputs (min/max minutes)
  - [x] Time range toggle with start/end time inputs
  - [x] Days of week checkboxes
  - [x] Minimum reward input
  - [x] Preset system (save/load/delete)

## Phase 2: Options Page Integration ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement filter settings loading in options.js
- [x] Add filter settings saving functionality
- [x] Create filter preset management system
- [x] Implement all filter event handlers:
  - [x] Task type change handling
  - [x] Duration range validation and handling
  - [x] Time range toggle and input handling
  - [x] Days of week selection handling
  - [x] Minimum reward input handling
  - [x] Preset selection, save, and delete handling
- [x] Add real-time sync for filter settings
- [x] Implement time range visibility control

## Phase 3: Content Script Integration
- [ ] Update content.js to handle filter settings
- [ ] Implement task filtering logic in content script
- [ ] Add filter validation and error handling
- [ ] Test filter functionality with actual RaterHub tasks

## Phase 4: Background Script Integration
- [ ] Update background.js to handle filter-related messages
- [ ] Implement filter persistence and synchronization
- [ ] Add filter validation in background script

## Phase 5: Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Test all filter types individually
- [ ] Test preset functionality
- [ ] Test real-time sync across all components
- [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Performance testing with multiple filters

## Phase 6: Documentation & Polish
- [ ] Update README with filter features
- [ ] Create user guide for filter usage
- [ ] Add tooltips and help text for filter options
- [ ] Final code review and optimization

## Current Status: Phase 2 COMPLETED ✅
The filter UI and functionality has been fully implemented in options.js with:
- Task type filtering (search, evaluation, comparison)
- Duration range filtering (min/max minutes)
- Time range filtering (start/end time with enable/disable)
- Days of week filtering
- Minimum reward filtering
- Preset system for saving/loading filter configurations
- Real-time synchronization across extension components

## Files Modified:
- `options.html` - Added filter UI controls
- `options.js` - Implemented filter functionality and event handlers

## Next Steps: Begin Phase 3 - Content Script Integration
